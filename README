🚀 Exploring Farsante for Fake Data Generation in Python!

Farsante is a library for generating fake data in Python, and honestly, I found it incredibly straightforward. Unlike other libraries like Faker, Farsante doesn’t require writing much of a code to generate custom and complex data, making it perfect for data scientists and engineers who need to create test datasets for testing. 🎯
It gives you a lot of methods in built in classes like Person, Address, etc., allowing you to choose from a variety, for your fake data allowing you to come up with better test cases.

For those working with small or large datasets and looking for flexibility in generating either Python or PySpark data frames, Farsante is an excellent choice. 
✋🏾 My favorite part? Farsante integrates seamlessly with Pandas via the pandas_df() function, allowing for easy generation of structured data in DataFrames – perfect for any data science workflow!

Of course, it’s not without a couple of drawbacks:
➡ Performance: Farsante is slower than Faker, clocking in about 60% slower. This is due to power of handling creation of complex fake data.

💡 If you need quick, structured fake data without the extra coding, give Farsante a try! https://lnkd.in/e9DQD9AE 🔥
